        The San Telmo market is one of the biggest street markets and is a must-do for any visitors in Buenos Aires on a
        Sunday. The lively market stretches for nearly 2km through the charming cobbled streets of Buenos Aires' oldest
        neighbourhood. Browsing through the assortment of trinkets, vintage clothing and curios from another era, you
        get a sense of Argentina's storied past.

        You can also find local artisan leather goods, jewelry and other crafts as well
        as artworks from local artists, making it the perfect place to shop for souvenirs. The streets also come alive
        later in the day with tango dancers, drummers and street performers. Take your time to wander the length of
        Defensa then finish with a cerveza or glass of vino tinto in Plaza Dorrego at sundown.</p>
